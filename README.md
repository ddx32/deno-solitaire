# deno-solitaire

A simple solitaire game written in TypeScript. Can be run using Deno on the command line (or Node if you transpile it). Inspired by the great [minimalist Python implementation](https://github.com/tteeoo/solitaire) by Theo Henson. The controls and the interface are the same as in the Python version, which had a few bugs that I tried to fix, but because I suck at Python I figured it would be easier for me to just rewrite it in TypeScript.
